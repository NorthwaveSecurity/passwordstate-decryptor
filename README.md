# Info

This script will decrypt PasswordState entries for PasswordState versions before Passwordstate 8..9 - Build 8903 (released April 6th 2020). During that update Clickstudios changed the way data was encrypted/decrypted. 

## Usage

1. Import the PasswordStateDecryptor module.
    - `Import-Module .\PasswordStateDecryptor.ps1`
2. Point the script towards the web.config file.
    - `Invoke-PasswordStateDecryptor -WebConfig 'C:\inetpub\PasswordState\web.config'`
3. Watch the script get and decrypt all password entries!

**All options**

SYNOPSIS

    accompanied blog or the source code.

SYNTAX
    Invoke-PasswordStateDecryptor [[-WebConfig] <String>] [[-SecretSplitterDLL] <String>] [[-FIPSMode] <Boolean>]
    [[-ConnectionString] <String>] [[-Secret1] <String>] [[-Secret3] <String>] [[-CSVPath] <String>] [[-EncryptionKey]
    <String>] [<CommonParameters>]


DESCRIPTION
    Invoke-PasswordStateDecryptor will connect to the database, extract all of
    the information necessary to derive the encryption key, decrypt and return the
    plaintext passwords for all entries in the database.
    This script is intended to be run on a host that has all of the following:
        * SQLServer database server with PasswordState database
        * web.config from the original compromised PasswordState server
        * Moserware.SecretSplitter.dll somewhere (shipped in the repo or on the disk)
    An example of such a host is the PasswordState server itself.

    Alternatively, if you are able to compromise the database, export all entries to CSV
    and the secret1 and secret3 or the encryption key, you can use the script offline. The
    CSV should contain (at least) the following fields: UserName, Password, Description and Title
